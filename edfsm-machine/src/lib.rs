/// the state machine specification, ie the `Fsm` implementation.
/// Conversely, the wiring or inputs and outputs is independent of the underlying state machine
/// and involves channels and adapters.
///
/// A `Machine` also has a data structure used to perform side effects, including generating output messages.
/// The type of this is also part of the state machine specification (the `SE` associated type).  
/// Note: side effects must be synchronous. If they may block they should be bracketed with
/// tokio's `block_in_place` or equivalent.
///
/// A machine is created by functions `machine` or `machine_with_effects`.
/// It is wired to other machines or channels by functions `input`, `with_output`, `merge_output` and
/// `with_event_log`.

/// The machine is made runnable by function `task`.  This is a future intended to be spawned onto
/// the tokio (or other) runtime.
///
/// Once running, a `Machine`
/// - initialises state, which may involve replaying messages from the event log
/// - performs initial effects
/// - enters the main loop, which is dirven by messages received on the input channel
/// - each message may cause the state to evolve and/or generate side effects
/// - an event is logged if the state changed
