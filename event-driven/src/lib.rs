//! Event driven Finite State Machines process commands (possibly created by other
//! events), performing some side effect, and emitting events.
//! Commands are processed against a provided state. Events can be applied to states
//! to yield new states.

/// Describes the behavior of a Finite State Machine (FSM) that can receive commands and produce
/// events. Along the way, effects can be performed given the receipt of a command.
/// State can be reconsituted by replaying events.
///
/// Note that effects are represented by a separate structure so that they can be consolidated,
/// and also to help structure the code. Further, it is possible to have multiple implementations
/// of effects e.g. different ones when testing.
///
/// Effects are also synchronous. If an effect handler must communicate, say, with a task in a
/// non-blocking fashion, then the state machine should represent this intermediate state. For
/// example, a channel could be used to communicate with such a task with `try_send` being used
/// and then causing a state transition in relation to that result. While this approach adds
/// steps to a state machine, it does allow them to remain responsive to receiving more
/// commands.
