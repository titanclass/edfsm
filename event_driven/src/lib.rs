//! Event driven Finite State Machines process commands (possibly created by other
//! events), performing some side effect, and emitting events.
//! Commands are processed against a provided state. Events can be applied to states
//! to yield new states.

/// Describes the behavior of a Finite State Machine (FSM) that can receive commands and produce
/// events. Along the way, effects can be performed given the receipt of a command.
/// State can be reconsituted by replaying events.
///
/// Note that effects are represented by a separate structure so that they can be consolidated,
/// and also to help structure the code. Further, it is possible to have multiple implementations
/// of effects e.g. different ones when testing.
///
/// Effects are also synchronous. If an effect handler must communicate, say, with a task in a
/// non-blocking fashion, then the state machine should represent this intermediate state.
///
/// The generic types refer to:
/// S  = State          - the state of your FSM
/// C  = Command        - the command(s) that are able to be processed on your FSM
/// E  = Event          - the event(s) that are emitted having performed a command
/// SE = State Effect   - the effect handler
